<h2>File Structure</h2>

<p class="alert alert-info">From v0.3.2 the mean project has become a lot more modular with the introduction of packages. As a result when possible application specific code should be part of a custom package allowing you to easily upgrade your mean version in the future</p>

<h4>Server side code</h4>
<p> <p>
<p>All of the Server side code resides in the <strong>/server</strong> directory.</p>
<span class="label label-info">Server</span>
<pre>
server
--- config						# Configuration Files (see below)
--- controllers                                         # Server side logic goes here
--- models						# schema models goes here
--- routes						# rest api endpoints routing - here
--- views						# swig based html rendering - here
</pre>
